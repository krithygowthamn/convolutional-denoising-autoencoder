# Convolutional Autoencoder for Image Denoising

## AIM

To develop a convolutional autoencoder for image denoising application.

## Problem Statement and Dataset
Autoencoder is an unsupervised artificial neural network that is trained to copy its input to output.MNIST is a dataset of black and white handwritten images of size 28x28.Denoising is the process of removing noise. This can be an image, audio, or document.These noisy digits will serve as our input data to our encoder.

## Convolution Autoencoder Network Model
